## Introduction

This class internalizes the store, state and action trilogy of redux in a single objects. 

Actions are created off the `store.addAction` method, which unlike a switch based system allows for 
actions to be added dynamically by client processes. 

## Store 

Store is a self contained redux-based state machine. It internalizes the state function and allows for 
dynamic addition of actions. 

It decorates an internal redux store, exposing 

* getState
* subscribe
* dispatch

with all the expected behaviors from redux. 

### Expanded (lazy) dispatch

Dispatch accepts an object, which must have a type (string) property. It also accepts two expanded signatures:

``` javascript

myState.dispatch(TYPE, object);

myState.dispatch(TYPE, KEY, VALUE);

```

So al three of these calls have the same effect:

``` javascript

myState.dispatch({type: 'ADD', value: 4});
myState.dispatch('ADD', {value: 4});
myState.dispatch('ADD', 'value', 4);

```

### Constructor

Store's constructor is the initial state. its optional; if ommitted initial state is empty object. 

### addAction

Store exposes

* addAction(name, handler)

to allow for on-the-fly definitions of actions that can be dispatched. the handler is a method with the signature

``` javascript

(action, state) => { }

```

... where action is the dispatched object and state is the previous state. 

### Chaining

`addAction` and `dispatch` are chainable (return self) allowing:

```
var state = new State({value: 1});
var afterState = state.addAction('ADD', (action, state) => {value: state.value + action.value})
.dispatch('ADD', 'value', 4)
.dispatch('ADD', 'value', 6);

// afterState.value = 10;

```

### Nesting States

States can have states as properties of their state. (I know this is a bit screwy but I can't figure out a better way to say it.)

As seen in the spec: 

``` javascript 

    var start = {
        one: new Store({value: 0}).addAction(ADD, ADD_METHOD)
    }

    var store = new Store(start);

    nestedTest.same(store.getState(), {one: {value: 0}});

    store.dispatch(`one.${ADD}`, {add: 5});

    nestedTest.same(store.getState(), {one: {value: 5}});
    
```

note, `getState()` recursively boils down any sub-properties into their current getState() values. If you want to access 
a property of state that is a known state, you must call `myStore.getState(true)` that disables this post-process.

Also, as long as you dispatch actions from the root state, all actions should alert subscribers, 
whether the action ultimately updates the root state or the child state. i.e.,

``` javascript

var dispatchCount = 0;

var start = {
    one: new Store({value: 0}).addAction(ADD, ADD_METHOD)
}

var store = new Store(start);

var u = store.subscribe(() => ++dispatchCount);

store.dispatch(`one.${ADD}`, {add: 5});

nestedTest.equal(dispatchCount, 1);

```

... however `store.getState(true).one.dispatch('ADD', 'value', 5)` would not alert any subscribers to store. 
This is intentional to allow local subscription to state's substates when that is a desired behavior. 

#### dispatching to a nested state

If property 'foo' of state is a subState and it has an action 'bar', calling `myState('foo.bar') will apply the action 'bar'
to `state.foo`.
